# DriverPass summary.

DrivePAss project involved creating a system for the client, DriverPass that wanted a system that could support their business of providing driver education services, including functionalities like online learning, booking driving lessons, managing training packages, and handling user accounts for various roles (Students, drivers, instructors, engineers, and administrators)(. The goal was to develop a user-friendly, secure, and reliable platform that allowed for efficient management of driving lessons, customers accounts, and content that complied with regulations. This software would have to be accessible both online and on mobile devices.

# What I did well

I was able to construct a general understanding and idea of what the client wanted as well as outline the various sytems that were needed, giving a detailed list of everything that would be needed from system design to security and compliance concerns. Additionally, I was able to communicate these needs tothe client effectively.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Hands down, the diagrams at the end of the semester. I really suck at diagraming things and this project was no exception. While I understand the importantce of such things, using CASE tools is not my strong point.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needed a system that needed four things: high availablility, high scalability, robust security, and meeting compliance needs. The system was designed to meet these four specific criteria while also encouraging an easy to use UX. Considering the user's needs when designing a system like DiverPass is important because you need to deliver what the stakeholder wants, not what you think they might want or how you've specifically interpreted their wants in your own way. Which means understanding what the client has determined is important is key to created a system like DriverPass.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I design software based on feedback. Generally, I start with an idea or concept, then research the market based on that idea and continually improve on that idea until a niche that I can service is discovered. From there it's a matter of developing the software in a manner that meets project objectives. In the case of DriverPass it would be to use an agile methodology that allows for the rapid developing and deployment (as well as nimbleness to pivot when business needs change). In the future, I would use more feedback loops between development, project management, stakeholders, and end-users to analyze and design a system. The more feedback loops, the better (assuming we're not drowing in feedback and can't develop anything because of the amount of data inflow).
